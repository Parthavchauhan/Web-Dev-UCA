    - `defer`: The script will be executed after the HTML document has been completely parsed. It maintains the order of scripts.

    - `async`: The script will be executed as soon as it is downloaded, without waiting for the HTML document to finish parsing. It does not guarantee the order of execution if multiple scripts are present. -->
